          <p>I always believed that growing up with technology in the 90’s made those of us in my generation equally adept at
            using technology such as simple things like converting word documents to PDFs or printing over WIFI. It wasn’t
            until recently that I realized for some interacting with technology is actually tiresome and infuriating. <br> <br>
             I
            started understanding that my co-workers were not burnt out because of the intensity of working with Crisis
            Clients but instead it was the tediousness of documentation on programs. My co-worker actually told me she missed
            the days of penciling-people-in, I was shocked to realize she meant actually using a pencil to create a calendar
            for herself and her clients. Technology is supposed to save time, not create resentment.I would miss my
            appointments if I didn’t have a reminder blaring the time it would take me to get to my destinations. <br> <br>
            
            I am fascinated by our personal mental frustrations that bubble up from using technology that is supposed to be for
            our benefit. Furthermore the way we speak to each other over the internet has varied our persona contrasting our
            treatment to each other one on one. Even our face to face interactions have changed because of the world wide web
            we hold in our hands, with just a phone. I began this journey into understanding coding because I honestly
            believe there should be more of a gap bridged between the mental health world and the tools that have rapidly
            changed our lives. <br> <br>
            
            My first love will always be focusing on each others well-being through psychological
            understanding, but what is technology if not a better way to connect with more people (it might even reveal our
            psychological reaction to hearing the sound of dial-up.)</p>
